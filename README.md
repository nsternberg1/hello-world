# hello-world
Hello World project for CSC430-FA2023

My name is Noah Sternberg, and this is my senior year at MSU. I am a CSC major and mathematics minor, with a primary interest in back end development and programming language design. I have had 2 internships, one the summer of my sophomore year and the duration of my junior year at United Systems and Software, and most recently this summer for IBM and HCL-Tech, working on their DevOps product, currently called IBM UrbanCode. In my free time I enjoy reading, playing video games, and working on a few of my personal projects.
